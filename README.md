# Mixnode API Sucks...

I won't be able to continue with the project due to Mixnode API limitations: [https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/#audio-streams](https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/#audio-streams)

# ~Mixnode ðŸŽ¶~
~Desktop app for Mixcloud inspired by @soundnode~

# ~Development~

1. ~Clone repo~
2. ~Move to app directory: `cd app`~
3. ~Install dependencies `yarn install`~
4. ~Run app: `yarn start`~
